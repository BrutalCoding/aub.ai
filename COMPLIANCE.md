# AGPLv3 Compliance

We have designed AubAI as an Open Source software for the Open Source software community. This requires applications to consider whether their usage of AubAI is in compliance with the GNU AGPLv3 [license](https://github.com/BrutalCoding/aub.ai/blob/main/LICENSE).

We cannot make the determination as to whether your application's usage of AubAI is in compliance with the AGPLv3 license requirements. You should instead rely on your own legal counsel or licensing specialists to audit and ensure your application is in compliance with the licenses of AubAI and all other open-source projects with which your application integrates or interacts. We understand that AGPLv3 licensing is complex and nuanced. It is for that reason we strongly encourage using experts in licensing to make any such determinations around compliance instead of relying on apocryphal or anecdotal advice.

AubAI Commercial Licensing is the best option for applications that trigger AGPLv3 obligations (e.g. open sourcing your application). Applications using AubAI - or any other OSS-licensed code - without validating their usage do so at their own risk.
